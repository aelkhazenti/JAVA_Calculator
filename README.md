### :one: JAVA 
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA) meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

### :two: Swing 

Swing is a graphical library for the Java programming language, part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) package, included in J2SE. Swing constitutes one of the main evolutions brought by Java 2 compared to the previous versions.

### :three: AWT 

Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is a graphics library for Java, part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). This library was introduced in the first versions of Java; since Java 2, the official window management library is Swing. However, AWT still serves as the foundation for Swing, since many Swing classes inherit from AWT classes.
